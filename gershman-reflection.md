* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

    * I was still a bit shaky on integrating pull requests from github following my git workflow, and I hadn’t had experience with git fetch, git merge, or merge conflicts. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

    * I was definitely able to strengthen my understanding of git flow and github workflow, and merge conflicts are much easier to understand now.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

    * I asked my pair and my guide questions about syntax, and my guide was able to better explain merge conflicts and git fetch/merge.

* What still confuses you about Git?

    * i think i am still just a little bit short of fully understanding how exactly merges in git affect merges in github; i didn’t get a chance to explore that more fully with my guide this time around.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

    * This was a very new experience for me, and I learned that I need to work harder at being less of a backseat driver and allowing my partner to work things out on his/her own. I sometimes get a little overzealous when it comes to finding a solution and I should be more conscientious of my partner’s voice.
