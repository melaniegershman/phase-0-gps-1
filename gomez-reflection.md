###What still confuses you about Git?
I just need to understand exactly when i should use the pull request. I reference the git workflow steps and i'm feeling comfortable with them, but i just need to have a few real life cases to fully grasp the concept a pull request and what best practices are. 

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I definitely see how these are valuable experiences during the phase 0 and it showed me the intensity and preparation that my partner had which has insired me to set it up.

Overall it was a great experience and i'm looking forward to the next one.'
